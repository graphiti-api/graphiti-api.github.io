Why Graphiti
============

I've written GraphQL and had a pleasant experience. I have enourmous respect for GraphQL. I also believe there is a fundamental flaw in GraphQL's design.

Let's remember [why people like GraphQL](https://dev.to/smizell/why-people-like-graphql-221c) in the first place: because it addressed common frustrations with REST APIs:

> *[We] heard from integrators that our REST API also wasn't very flexible. It sometimes required two or three separate calls to assemble a complete view of a resource. It seemed like our responses simultaneously sent too much data and didnâ€™t include data that consumers needed.*
>
> \- ["The Github Graph API"](https://githubengineering.com/the-github-graphql-api), **GitHub Engineering**

GraphQL solves real problems. Its flaw is that it solved these
problems using zero-sum thinking: we must
abandon the existing paradigm and forge a new one. It's GraphQL
versus REST, one or the other. [REST is dead, long live GraphQL](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/rest-apis-are-rest-in-peace-apis-long-live-graphql-d412e559d8e4).

Graphiti instead approaches the problem using [positive-sum thinking](http://aturon.github.io/2018/06/02/listening-part-2):

> *Positive-sum thinking is how we embrace pluralism while retaining a coherent vision and set of values...A zero-sum view would assume that apparent oppositions are fundamental, e.g., that appealing to the JS crowd inherently hurts the C++ one. A positive-sum view starts by seeing different perspectives and priorities as legitimate and worthwhile, with a faith that* **by respecting each other in this way, we can find strictly better solutions than had we optimized solely for one perspective.**
>
> \- ["Listening and Trust"](http://aturon.github.io/2018/06/02/listening-part-2), **Aaron Turon**

GraphQL optimized around REST's shortcomings, and in doing so it dropped
REST's advantages. There is no need for such a zero-sum tradeoff. We can take
everything great about GraphQL and build it ***on top of*** REST (and
HTTP!), instead of replacing it altogether. We can have our cake and eat it too.

You'll find plenty of [GraphQL posts](https://www.howtographql.com/basics/1-graphql-is-the-better-rest) that describe REST as an inflexible paradigm of a bygone era, a lack of granularity that necessarily leads to data under- and over-fetching.

It's true that many REST APIs work this way, but this is not REST. While there's
endless debate around which APIs are considered "RESTful", I don't think
we need to look much further than what the letters actually stand for:

<div class="spacer"></div>

This is the most simple example of Representional State Transfer. Marcus transfered the state of his farm to me using a representation. The representation of the farm is the plain sentence: "4 pigs, 12 chickens, 3 cows".*

In other words, **this is REST**:

<div class="spacer"></div>
<p align="center">
  <img width="80%" src="/assets/img/rest1.gif" />
</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>

We're moving an object from the server to the client, possibly modifying
that object, then moving back to the server.

The other important aspect of REST is **Links**. Because all objects are
addressable at a URL, we can use HTTP links to connect Resources. This
allows for (among other things) **lazy-loading** - the logic connecting Resources can be
changed server-side without breaking clients. If we have a "Top
Comments" relationship, we can redefine "Top" without disturbing
clients.

<div class="spacer"></div>
<p align="center">
  <img width="80%" src="/assets/img/rest2.gif" />
</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>

Pretty simple right? Here's how we might implement this in GraphQL:

{% highlight typescript %}
type CreateEmployeeInput {
  name: String
  age: Int
}

type CreateEmployeePayload {
  employee: Employee
}

type UpdateEmployeeInput {
  employeeId: ID!
  name: String
  age: Int
}

type UpdateEmployeePayload {
  employee: Employee
}

type DestroyEmployeeInput {
  id: ID!
}

type DestroyEmployeePayload {
  employee: Employee
}

type Employee {
  id: ID!
  name: String
}

createEmployee(input: CreateEmployeeInput!): CreateEmployeePayload
updateEmployee(input: UpdateEmployeeInput!): UpdateEmployeePayload
destroyEmployee(input: DestroyEmployeeInput!): DestroyEmployeePayload

employee(id: ID!): Employee
{% endhighlight %}

The first thing to note is that GraphQL is super badass at describing
fields and types. The next thing to note is that fields and types are
the wrong abstraction.

Defining a schema like this allows bespoke, fine-grained detail. If we
wanted, the `CreateEmployeePayload` could be different than the
`UpdateEmployeePayload` - same for inputs like `CreateEmployeeInput` and
`UpdateEmployeeInput`. If we wanted other actions, like
`promoteEmployee` or `deactivateEmployee`, they would be easy to add and
follow the same basic constructs.

This is **RPC** - hand-crafted, custom requests. We have a high level of
**configuration** but a low level of **convention**. Not only will
developers have to spend more time hand-crafting these requests, but
patterns are likely to diverge from one API to the next, from team to
team, as time moves on. In fact, the above is really a best-case
scenario with common naming convention of `create/update/destroy` - the
Github API adds verbs like `add`, `remove`, `lock`, `move` and more.

Oh, and we dropped support for lazy-loading along the way.

{% include h.html tag="h2" text="Conventions" a="conventions" %}

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/img/conformity.png">
</p>

The benefit of REST over RPC is conventions. Conventions cause increased
productivity and consistency (leading to fewer misunderstandiings and
chances for bugs). Let's start thinking in REST, and see where it takes
us.

In REST, we know the input and output is always the Resource:

{% highlight typescript %}
type Employee {
  id: ID!
  name: string
}

createEmployee(input: Employee): Employee
updateEmployee(input: Employee!): Employee
destroyEmployee(input: Employee!): Employee

employee(id: ID): Employee
{% endhighlight %}

OK, a little tighter. But there's actually no reason to type this out
each time - we can assume developers are already familiar with the
convention.

{% highlight typescript %}
type Employee {
  id: ID!
  name: string
}

createEmployee
updateEmployee
destroyEmployee

employee(id: ID)
{% endhighlight %}

Getting there. OK, and we know we're dealing with an Employee, and we
know we won't have custom verbs like `promote` or `remove` - we're
moving objects here, and nothing else (if that throws you for a mental
loop, see [this presentation by Derek Prior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HctYHe-YjnE), Engineering Manager at
GitHub).

{% highlight typescript %}
type Employee {
  id: ID!
  name: string
}

create
update
destroy
show // employee(id: ID)
index // employee()
{% endhighlight %}

By adopting conventions, we not only removed boilerplate - we removed
the chance of subtle inconsistencies. This is better for both providers
and consumers of the API.

We're just getting started.

The above schema covers basic CRUD. But we probably want to filter data, right? Let's say we want to return all employees with a given name:

{% highlight typescript %}
employee(id: ID, name: String)
{% endhighlight %}

Again, we're seeing chances for inconsistency. What's the `name`
parameter - straight equality? Case sensitive? Contains? I guess we
could throw a bunch of suffixes at it:

{% highlight typescript %}
employee(id: ID, name_eq: String, name_suffix: String, name_prefix: String, name_contains: String, name_not_eq: String, name_not_suffix: String, name_prefix: String, name_not_prefix: String)
{% endhighlight %}

Works, but a bit unwieldy...and again, likely to diverge wildly across
implementations.

What about sorting? Should we do it similar to the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/)?:

{% highlight typescript %}
enum OrderDirection {
  ASC
  DESC
}

enum EmployeeOrderField {
  ID
  NAME
}

type EmployeeOrder {
  field: EmployeeOrderField!
  direction: OrderDirection
}

employee(orderBy: EmployeeOrder)
{% endhighlight %}

Or should we do it like [How to
GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/8-filtering-pagination-and-sorting/)?:

{% highlight typescript %}
enum EmployeeOrderByInput {
  id_ASC
  id_DESC
  name_ASC
  name_DESC
}

employee(orderBy: EmployeeOrderByInput)
{% endhighlight %}

We have divergent APIs right off the bat, and neither one supports
multisort.

## Rethinking REST

<p align="center">
  <img width="100%" src="/assets/img/rethink-rest-graffiti.jpg" />
</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>

Earlier, we covered RESTfully moving an object between the server and
the client. Those objects connected together with Links, which allowed
for lazy-loading.

Instead of throwing away this paradigm, what if we just **added
eager-loading**?

<div class="spacer"></div>
<p align="center">
  <img width="80%" src="/assets/img/rest3.gif" />
</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>

REST doesn't have a query
specification or built-in schema, but it does have this Resource concept. **Instead of
thinking of a bag fields and types, what if we thought in Resources**?:

Resources have **Attributes**. An `Employee` has a `first_name` which is
a `string`, an `age` which is an `integer`, and so forth.

We'd probably want to filter and sort by these attributes right? We might add
some additional filters and sorts, we might want to opt-out of others,
but querying a Resource by its attributes serves as a reasonable
baseline.

If we have an attribute and it's a `string`, we know we're
talking about operators like `suffix` and `prefix`, but an `integer`
attribute would want operators like `greater_than` and `less_than`.

Resources also have **relationships** to other Resources. We should be
able to lazy-load those relationships (with **Links**), or eager-load
those relationships. Whether lazy or eager, the same logic should apply.

If we defined these Resources, with their attributes and relationships,
then **the input and the output wouldn't actually matter**. Or more
accurately: we can ***accept** and **render** whatever payload we want*. Maybe
we'll even dynamically serve different payloads based on `Content-Type`.

OK, so really we don't need to define *inputs* and *outputs* - those can
be assumed by convention, swapped on-demand. What we really need to define is the **Resource**.

{% include h.html tag="h2" text="Welcome to Graphiti" a="welcome-to-graphiti" %}

{% highlight ruby %}
class EmployeeResource < ApplicationResource
  attribute :name, :string, sortable: true, filterable: true
  attribute :age, :integer, writable: false
end
{% endhighlight %}

With nothing but this Resource definition and some assumed conventions,
we get all this behavior out of the box:

* Create
* Update
* Delete
* Read
  * Filter
    * String (`name`)
      * `eq` (case sensitive)
      * `eql` (case insensitive)
      * `prefix`
      * `suffix`
      * `match`
      * `not_*` (`not_eq`, `not_prefix`, etc)
    * Dates and Numbers (`age`)
      * `eq`
      * `gt` (greater than)
      * `lt` (less than)
      * `gte` (greater than/equal to)
      * `lte` (less than/equal to)
  * Sort / Multisort
  * Paginate
  * Fieldsets

Not just an API contract, but **out-of-the-ðŸ“¦ behavior**. If we know
the configuration of a Resource, we can **automate query and persistence
operations**. Obviously we'll need lots of ways to customize and
override, and support for any number of datastores and clients. But if
we have the configuration, a defined contract for querying and
persistence data, we can build patterns around it.

There's more to this than a bunch of out-of-the-ðŸ“¦ standards and
behavior. If we thought only in Fields and Types, we'd use GraphiQL to
see something like:

<br />

<p align="center">
  <img width="30%" class="drop" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55264/52915902-78418d80-32a7-11e9-8515-021312258400.png" />
</p>

<br />

But if we thought in Resources, it's not just a big bag of fields. We're
able to organize those fields around meaningful concepts:

<br />

<p align="center">
  <img width="40%" class="drop" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55264/52916024-e3d82a80-32a8-11e9-8bb6-07ac9bf988dc.png" />
</p>

<br />

This screenshot is from [Vandal]({{site.github.url}}/guides/vandal), the Graphiti UI.

Because we started with a better abstraction, we ended with a more
intuitive
UI. As a marketer-turned-programmer myself, I really
appreciate when data exploration tools like this are friendly to
less-technical users. A user of Vandal doesn't need to know about `Connection`s
or `Edge`s, they just need to click around. I like that my product owner and I can walk
through the domain together, validating concepts and solidifying a shared
understanding.

{% include h.html tag="h4" text="HTTP Endpoints" a="http-endpoints" %}

While both GraphQL and Graphiti can fetch your graph of data in a single
request, GraphQL does this with a single endpoint. Graphiti keeps
RESTful URLs, for three reasons. First, HTTP caching: [Phil Sturgeon has
an excellent comparison of GraphQL and endpoint-based caching here](https://philsturgeon.uk/api/2017/01/26/graphql-vs-rest-caching/).

Second, adding endpoints allows for customization. Maybe we want to send
a welcome email when we `POST /employees` but not when we `POST
/admin/employees`. Maybe `/exemplary_employees` applies additional query
logic by default, but wants to re-use everything else. In other words,
Resources form your graph, but Endpoints *expose* that graph to the
outside world (and hold relevant logic around exposure). Read more in
our [Endpoints Guide]({{site.github.url}}/guides/concepts/endpoints).

The third reason is lazy-loading with [Links]({{site.github.url}}/graphiti/guides/concepts/links), which we'll cover in a bit.

{% include h.html tag="h4" text="Schema" a="schema" %}

We even get schema benefits. Schemas are great for tooling and
backwards-compatibility checks...but when they are oriented around
Fields and Types, they can only tell you so much. When they are oriented
around Resources, they can expose less-obvious concepts. Maybe we sort
Employees by `created_at` by default:

{% highlight ruby %}
{
  name: "EmployeeResource",
  type: "employees",
  attributes: { ... },
  default_sort: [{ "created_at": "desc" }],
  ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

Because this is specified in the schema, not only are clients more
informed, but changing this default would raise a backwards-compatibility
error:

{% highlight error %}
EmployeeResource: default sort changed from [{:created_at=>"desc"}] to [{:last_name=>"asc"}].
{% endhighlight %}

When developing in Graphiti, we introspect your Resources and
automatically generate the schema for you. Backwards-compatibility
checks can be done with a command-line task, or whenever your tests run.

{% include h.html tag="h2" text="Graphs" a="graphs" %}

You may be thinking, "*OK, but REST only works for a single object. I'll
have to make multiple requests, and be right back where I started. I
need GraphQL to solve this problem*".

Not true.

Years before GraphQL came out, respected developers from different
companies and backgrounds came together and began the discussion on how to improve REST
APIs. This wasn't a project pushed by a hundred-billion dollar
company; it was an organic, community-driven effort. The result was the [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org) standard,
which tackled granular queries long ago:

{% highlight ruby %}
# GET /employees?include=positions

{
  data: {
    id: "123",
    type: "employees",
    attributes: { name: "Kayla Webb" },
    relationships: {
      positions: {
        data: { id: "456", type: "positions" }
      }
    }
  },
  included: [
    {
      id: "456",
      type: "positions",
      attributes: { title: "Engineer" }
    }
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

Wonky payload, right? First of all, don't be scared. In Graphiti,
you can add `.json` to the URL and output a more traditional flat
structure:

{% highlight ruby %}
{
  data: {
    id: "123",
    name: "Jeesoo Ryoo",
    positions: [{ id: "456", title: "Engineer" }]
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

You can absolutely develop in Graphiti this way, but you'd be giving up
some smart things JSON:API does. One example is de-duplicating each node
in the graph: if we're listing 100 `Post`s and they all have the same
`Author`, you'll have to render that `Author` 100 times. JSON:API would
only render it once.

Another is the `type/id` combo:

<p align="center">
  <div style="width: 500px;margin:auto">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Namely, those constraints are that all entities must be addressable top level by type and ID. (Very similar to JSON:API in this respect.)</p>&mdash; Tom Dale (@tomdale) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomdale/status/786951015945895936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  </div>
</p>

There's a bunch of reasons this is important, but one I've always been
partial to is websockets. This `type/id` combo allows us to uniquely
identify records once they've been loaded in JS memory. So, every time a
Resource is saved we can push its state (JSON representation) to clients
with a websocket. Here I am randomly updating a bunch of backend data,
and watching the UI update in real-time.

<p align="center">
  <img width="80%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55264/38929932-042408da-42dc-11e8-93ec-16b0f9b62da3.gif" />
</p>
<br />

This took only a handful of lines of code, all of which could be
packaged into a library to make this automatic.

Another example is lazy-loading data with Links:

<p align="center">
  <div style="width: 500px;margin:auto">
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A GraphQL response is going to be as slow as the slowest subquery it has to execute to build the response.</p>&mdash; Tom Dale (@tomdale) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomdale/status/786952448799825921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  </div>
</p>

Instead of loading everying up-front, we want to defer loading for
performance reasons. Maybe we want to render our `Employee` detail page
super quick, and we don't need to list the `Position`s until the user
clicks something.

You can do this in GraphQL, but you need to bake logic into the client,
which means changing the logic would break clients (read more about
this in the [Links Guide]({{site.github.url}}/guides/concepts/links)).
Luckily, REST and JSON:API are optimized for lazy-loading:

{% highlight ruby %}
# ...
positions: {
  links: {
    related: 'http://example.com/api/positions?filter[employee_id]=123'
  }
}
# ...
{% endhighlight %}

Graphiti generates these Links between Resources automatically. If you
change the logic connecting Resources (which applies to eager loading as
well), we'll update the [Link]({{site.github.url}}/guides/concepts/links) - clients can simply follow the
link, and we can change logic server-side with no breakage.

There's a bunch of other great stuff about JSON:API, but that is a
topic for another day.

> (*Quick aside: I've always found the name of this project hilariously
awkward, easy to confuse with any API outputting JSON. But you could say
the same about GraphQL! Just as JSON:API isn't the only API standard
outputting JSON, GraphQL isn't the only Graph Query Language - in fact,
you could call JSON:API a Graph Query Language as well!*)

{% include h.html tag="h4" text="REST != Multiple Requests" a="rest-multiple-requests" %}

Anything you could do with a single Resource, you can do with multiple
Resources. In other words, we can fetch an `Employee`, and their
`Positions` - but only `active` positions where the title starts with
`Eng`, ordered by `created_at`. This is called **Deep Querying**.

The point here is that REST doesn't mean multiple requests. Sure, our
state is now a graph of objects instead of a single object, but there's
no need for a wholesale revamp. In fact, we don't need to change much at
all.

<p align="center">
  <img width="100%" src="/assets/img/persist.jpg" />
</p>

Just as we can **query** multiple Resources at once, we can also
**persist** multiple objects at once.

When persisting in REST, we send the same object back to the server
alongside a verb. That verb tells us if we're creating, updating (part
or whole), or deleting. Same thing here. Let's specify the verb
alongside the relationship:

{% highlight ruby %}
# ...
positions: {
  data: { id: "456", type: "positions", method: "destroy" }
}
# ...
{% endhighlight %}

There are only 4 possible verbs:

* `create`
* `update`
* `destroy`
* `disassociate`

Oh, and we'll run everything within a transaction, throwing in
conventions for data validation as well:

{% highlight ruby %}
# Response code 422

{
  code:  'unprocessable_entity',
  status: '422',
  title: "Validation Error",
  detail: "Name can't be blank",
  source: { pointer: '/data/attributes/name' },
  meta: {
    attribute: :name,
    message: "can't be blank",
    code: :blank
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Earlier, we covered how REST was optimized for lazy-loading. Graphiti
builds on top of REST to add eager-loading, and "eager-persisting". In
other words, we can both read and write a graph of data in a single
request.

{% include h.html tag="h2" text="(Micro) Services" a="microservices" %}

> *You should think hard before breaking up [a Majestic Monolith](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith); beware the tradeoffs. Still, if you need it, Graphiti has your back.*

We now have a consistent interface for queries and relationships. We
also covered how Resources connect together with Links. Put two and
two together, and you'll see a Resource doesn't need to be local to same
application. We can have cross-API, remote Resources as well.

The popular GraphQL platform Apollo does something similar with [Schema Stitching](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/schema-stitching.html):

<div class="spacer"></div>
<p align="center">
  <img width="50%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55264/52920133-506a1e00-32d7-11e9-8986-23795dbedc2c.png" />
</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>

You won't need to write code like this in Graphiti. Because we have
conventions, we can automate this stuff. Just supply a URL:

{% highlight ruby %}
class EmployeeResource < ApplicationResource
  has_many :positions, remote: 'http://example.com/api/positions'
end
{% endhighlight %}

That's it. Everything works the same. We can fetch an `Employee` and her `Position`s in a single
request, add additional local *or* remote Resources to the request, and
Deep Query. If you use Vandal, you'll think it's all the same API.

Microservices ðŸŽ‰!

check [StackOverflow for a quick summary of DDD](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1222392/can-someone-explain-domain-driven-design-ddd-in-plain-english-please/1222488#1222488):

> *DDD is about trying to make your software a model of a real-world system or process. In using DDD, you are meant to work closely with a domain expert who can explain how the real-world system works. For example, if you're developing a system that handles the placing of bets on horse races, your domain expert might be an experienced bookmaker.*
>
> *Between yourself and the domain expert, you build a ubiquitous language (UL), which is basically a conceptual description of the system. The idea is that you should be able to write down what the system does in a way that the domain expert can read it and verify that it is correct. In our betting example, the ubiquitous language would include the definition of words such as 'race', 'bet', 'odds' and so on.*

> *The concepts described by the UL will form the basis of your object-oriented design. DDD provides some clear guidance...recommends several patterns...*

I trim the quote because the prescriptive patterns of DDD often
overshadow its core concepts. [The creator of DDD, Eric Evans covered this in his
keynote last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2IAgnpkBck).

REST and Resources [force a developer to think deeply about their
domain, and this leads to better object-oriented code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFhoSMD6idk).
Rather than a bag of fields and types, Graphiti pushes you to think
critically about your domain.

A Resource is what DDD calls an [Entity](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2008/05/21/entities-value-objects-aggregates-and-roots/). REST is about moving Domain Entities from client to server and back again.

You don't ***need*** to know anything about DDD to develop in Graphiti.
But don't sleep on it.

{% include h.html tag="h2" text="Clients" a="clients" %}

You can use any HTTP client with Graphiti. If you're using JS, a simple
`fetch` will do.

But you may be looking for a more robust client, one that takes
advantage of Graphiti conventions. Look no further than
[Spraypaint]({{site.github.url}}/js), our
official client heavily inspired by ActiveRecord. Query your API the
same way you query your database:

{% highlight typescript %}
// All of this is chainable

let { data } = await Employee
  .where({ name: { prefix: "Jane" } })
  .order({ created_at: "desc" })
  .page(2).per(10)
  .select(['name', 'age'])
  .stat({ total: 'count' })
  .includes({ positions: 'department' })
  .all()

let record = data[0]
record.positions[0].department.name = 'Updated!'
await record.save({ with: { positions: 'department' } })
{% endhighlight %}

By relying on conventions we can move the URL, request, and response
under the hood, allowing you to focus on what matters - your domain.

{% include h.html tag="h2" text="GraphQL Support" a="graphql-support" %}

OK, let's come full circle. Let's say some of these conventions resonate
with you, but nevertheless you'd like to develop a GraphQL API. I ***still*** think
Graphiti is your best bet, because Graphiti supports GraphQL.

Remember, we started with this long-hand RPC code:

{% highlight typescript %}
type CreateEmployeeInput {
  name: String
  age: Int
}

type CreateEmployeePayload {
  employee: Employee
}

type UpdateEmployeeInput {
  employeeId: ID!
  name: String
  age: Int
}

type UpdateEmployeePayload {
  employee: Employee
}

type DestroyEmployeeInput {
  id: ID!
}

type DestroyEmployeePayload {
  employee: Employee
}

type Employee {
  id: ID!
  name: String
}

createEmployee(input: CreateEmployeeInput!): CreateEmployeePayload
updateEmployee(input: UpdateEmployeeInput!): UpdateEmployeePayload
destroyEmployee(input: DestroyEmployeeInput!): DestroyEmployeePayload

employee(id: ID!): Employee
{% endhighlight %}

Graphiti does not need all this boilerplate. But
if we have the short-hand, that means **we can automatically generate
the long-hand**. We can introspect the Graphiti Resources, and use
[graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby) to automatically generate GraphQL code.

That project is [graphiti-graphql](https://github.com/wadetandy/graphiti-graphql). While still more of an experiment at this stage, it's shaping up nicely. The main blockers are the conventions missing from any GraphQL API - how should we render validation errors, which sorting standard should we adopt, etc. But we have proof that if there's a target to hit, we can autogenerate it.

So we ***can*** generate GraphQL via Graphiti, but should we? Maybe! Not
an unreasonable pursuit. If you'd like to go down this route, I'd love
to hear from you!

Still, let's be clear what we're missing: HTTP caching, error codes, lazy-loading, and more.

When conventions form your programming foundation, you end up with these
high-level abstractions where a few lines of code hide the underlying
complexity. Often, this is flippantly referred to as âœ¨"**Magic**"ðŸ”®

The thing about magic is, once you learn the trick it often comes down
to something simple: a mirror, a trick deck, a quick hand.

An object, moving back and forth.

Simple concepts can often be the most powerful, and I will never get
tired of seeing this trick performed.

{% include h.html tag="h2" text="Addendum: Holy Shit" a="addendum" %}

I can't believe I just wrote all that. I swear, I never set out to do any of this.

There are a lot of big ideas here, but this project is not some ideological crusade. Three years ago I had a bug in my application, and I found it surprisingly tricky to fix. I kept pulling that string, I connected with other developers pulling their own strings, one thing led to another, and here we are. This project is nothing more than a good-faith effort to build quality software, based on my own personal experience.

Let's be clear: **GraphQL is awesome**. It solves real problems in a
user-friendly manner, has sexy tooling and amazing libraries created
by kickass developers. There are many advantages of GraphQL not covered
here, and plenty more great ideas I'd like to steal. If you find some of
the framing here annoying, if you find yourself thinking "*...but what
about X and Y?*", just know I feel the same way whenever a GraphQL
post talks about REST. It will be a continual goal of this project to
raise the level of debate.

Same for RPC. I work for a company that made billions off of RPC. I tend
to think REST is a better fit for the web, and RPC is a better fit for
things like financial trading systems or video games, but plenty of
reasonable people can disagree. Conventions and abstractions come with
their own cost: a learning curve, indirection, lack of flexibility. If
you prefer something more low-level, I completely understand. I'll
continue trying to learn from you.

Beware projects and ideologies that claim to be a solution to all your
problems. Everything has tradeoffs. The best we can do is to avoid
zero-sum thinking, and instead think about how we can take the best
ideas from a variety of solutions and experiences, striving to
continually improve. It is hard, it is exhausting, it is the right thing
to do.

Unless you like XML. Screw XML.
